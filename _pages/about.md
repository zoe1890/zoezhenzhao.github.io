# 🎓 About
Hi, I'm Zhen Zhao. I'm a third-year PhD candidate from the School of Design at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I am supervised by Prof. Hailiang Wang, along with my co-supervisors Prof. Jeffrey C.F. Ho and Prof. Brian Lee. My research interests are Embodied Haptic Interaction, User Experience Design, and Design for Active Aging, with a specific focus on technology-mediated health behavior change. I am dedicated to exploring how embodied design can be utilized to mediate human perception and motivate sustainable health behavior change.
